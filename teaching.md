- STAT 412/612, Statistical Programming in R
  - This course takes students with little or no background in
    computing and guides them through most of the material covered in
    [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

- STAT 413/613 Data Science
  - This course trains students on a suite of tools necessary for a
    successful career in Data Science, including version control
    (git), large(ish) data analysis (data.table), and data
    communication (R Shiny). I also provide a review of basic
    statistical inference and emphasize how one performs such
    inference in R. I teach this course almost entirely using GitHub
    Classroom.

- STAT 614 Statistical Methods
  - This course was designed to get physical and social science
    masters students proficient enough to analyze their own data and
    convey statistical results to their peers. This course focused on
    actually analyzing data, interpreting results, and effectively
    communicating statistical conclusions. My teaching website for
    this course is publicly available at

- STAT 234, Introductory Statistics
  - This course was a standard introduction to Statistics for
    non-majors plus some light mathematical theory. The content
    included introductions to probability, inference, and the R
    statistical computing language. My teaching website for this
    course is publicly available at
