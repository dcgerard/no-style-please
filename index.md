Hello! My name is David and I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at American University. I just finished a postdoctoral scholarship at the University of Chicago, working under Matthew Stephens, where I studied hierarchical modeling approaches to analyzing sequencing data. I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of Washington under Peter Hoff. My graduate work was on the statistical analysis of tensor data. You can read more about my work on my research page. If you want to see any code associated with my research, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/dcgerard) page.
